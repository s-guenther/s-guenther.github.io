Hi, I'm Sebastian Günther, a research software engineer and data scientist with
over 10 years of experience in scientific computing, renewable energy storage,
and mechatronic engineering. My focus is on combining engineering expertise with
cutting-edge software development to create tailored solutions for complex
computational challenges. Whether it's through modeling, simulation, or the
development of hardware prototypes, I bring a unique blend of practical and
theoretical knowledge to every project. 


#### Education & Expertise

I hold a Master’s degree in Mechatronics from the Otto-von-Guericke University
Magdeburg, where I specialized in mechanics, robotics, and simulation.
Currently, I’m finalizing my PhD in Hybrid Energy Storage Systems at the Leibniz
University Hannover, with a planned completion in early 2025. My research is
deeply rooted in renewable energies, energy transition, and the optimization of
energy storage systems, giving me hands-on expertise in these critical fields. 


#### Professional Background

I’ve gained extensive experience in research, project management, and software
development through my work in both academia and industry. This includes leading
projects on energy storage, flywheel energy storage systems, and scientific software
development, ensuring robust and scalable solutions. My background as a
researcher has provided me with expertise in data science,
mathematical modeling, machine learning, and optimization, alongside managing
industry projects. 

#### Practical Experience & Industry Engagement

I’ve led various industry projects, including developing a calculation tool for
wind park operators and contributing to the design of a sustainable energy-plus
housing community. I’ve also collaborated with organizations such as ecovillage
Hannover eG and TII Energy, gaining valuable insights into energy storage
technologies and industry requirements.
