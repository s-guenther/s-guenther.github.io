_This site is still under construction. Drop by occasionally and stay tuned for

Whether it’s large-scale simulations, data-driven models, or optimization of
algorithms, I focus on leveraging the latest computing techniques to deliver
efficient and scalable solutions to tackle complex problems
that conventional methods can’t handle. This includes using distributed computing
resources such as **HPC clusters**, **GPU computing**, or cloud-based
architectures to handle massive datasets or computational workloads. 

I ensure efficient and
scalable solutions. My experience spans key programming languages such as
**Python**, **Julia**, **Rust**, and **Matlab**, enabling computational
efficiency across fields like renewable energy for system simulations, energy
storage, or forecasting.  
I integrate parallel computing techniques and ensure all software is scalable,
maintainable, and optimized for evolving computational demands.
