_This site is still under construction. Drop by occasionally and stay tuned for

Bridging the gap between research and practical application often requires the
development of hardware prototypes. I specialize in designing and building
prototypes for mechatronic and electromechanical systems, helping to transform
theoretical concepts into functional solutions. 

My experience includes working on projects like energy storage systems,
intelligent sensor-actuator setups, and autonomous mechanical systems. By
leveraging my background in both mechanical and mechatronic engineering and
software development, I am able to deliver integrated solutions that combine
hardware and software seamlessly.
