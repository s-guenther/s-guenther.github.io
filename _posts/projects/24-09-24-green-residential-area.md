This project aimed to develop an optimized
energy model for a sustainable residential community. The project explored
various scenarios to balance energy efficiency with renewable energy
integration, focusing on heating, cooling, and electricity demands. It analyzed
how different building types, insulation standards, and renewable energy sources
like photovoltaic (PV) systems could impact energy use. 

Detailed consumption profiles for electricity, heating, and hot water were
generated through simulations, creating time-resolved power consumption and
generation profiles for a thorough analysis of the communityâ€™s energy needs. 
Beyond matching energy use with production, the project investigated how energy
storage and demand-side management could maximize self-consumption and reduce
grid dependence. Adjusting energy use, such as shifting tasks to periods of high
PV generation, helped align demand with production. 

Energy storage for electricity and heat, along with combined heat and power
(CHP) units, were also explored to further reduce energy imports and ensure a
stable power supply for the community. 
The simulations provided valuable insights into varying input parameters,
helping to design a flexible system that can adapt to weather fluctuations or
different energy demands. 

Overall, the project demonstrates how smart
energy planning, renewable energy, and storage solutions can create efficient,
self-sustaining residential areas that contribute significantly to the energy
transition.
