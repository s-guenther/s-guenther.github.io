 Flywheel energy storage systems
(FESS) stand out as a promising technology due to their high cycle life, rapid
response time, and efficient power-to-energy ratio. This project aimed to design
and construct a laboratory-scale flywheel system to serve both as a research
demonstrator and as an educational tool. 

The resulting prototype is a 200 Wh flywheel energy storage system, featuring a
rotor composed of high-strength aluminum and carbon fiber reinforced plastic
(CFRP). It spins at a nominal speed of 25,000 rpm, powered by a 3.5 kW permanent
magnet synchronous motor (PMSM). The flywheel operates at overcritical speeds
with medium vacuum conditions, minimizing windage losses and ensuring optimal
performance. Key components, such as the spindle bearings and power electronics,
were carefully selected to ensure smooth operation and control, even under
isolated conditions. 

One of the primary goals of this project was to design a system capable of
demonstrating the key features of flywheel technology. The FESS was built to
showcase flywheel capabilities at exhibitions and in academic settings, with
enough power to brew up to five cups of coffee on a single charge. This vivid
demonstration helps make the technology tangible, attracting interest in both
research and industry. Additionally, the system serves as a laboratory tool for
students, allowing them to study flywheel-specific phenomena such as dynamic
behavior, thermal response, and energy losses in real-time. 

A significant aspect of the design was the consideration of thermodynamic
behavior and rotordynamics. A lumped parameter model was developed to estimate
temperature distribution, and the system's rotordynamics were tuned using finite
element methods (FEM). This ensured that the flywheel operates safely and
efficiently, even at high speeds. The FESS’s modular setup also facilitates
research into various system parameters, such as vacuum levels, windage losses,
and bearing performance. 

The construction of the flywheel system involved a comprehensive 3D model and
technical drawings, ensuring precision and safety in every component. The design
was iterative, allowing for adjustments based on testing and simulations.
Mechanical safety considerations, such as stress distribution and tolerance for
overspeed, were integrated into the design to minimize the risk of failure. The
system’s housing and auxiliary equipment provide robust protection, while
maintaining a relatively compact form factor.
