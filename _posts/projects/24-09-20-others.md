#### Core Services

- Scaling calculations on high-performance computers (HPC).
- Accelerating existing models through refactoring with more efficient
  algorithms or programming languages. 
- Optimizing energy management in smart grids with machine learning
  algorithms. 
- Developing load forecasting algorithms for microgrids
- Development of a supervisory agent controlling an autonomous fleet in
  warehouses using model-predictive control. 
- Implementing machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition in large
  datasets to detect anomalies in production processes early. 
- Creating digital twins for monitoring and optimizing production systems.

#### Related Activities

- Supporting project teams at the intersection of research and software
  development. 
- Transitioning a prototype project into a university-supported research
  project and developing a research funding proposal. 
- Facilitating knowledge transfer between research institutes and industry
  partners. 
- Conducting feasibility studies for new technological approaches.
- Providing lectures and training.
- Consulting and advising on improving the software architecture of existing
  systems. 
- Advising on integrating artificial intelligence into existing production
  processes. 
- Creating white papers and studies on new technological developments and
  their applications. 
- Strategic consulting for planning and implementing digital transformation
  projects. 

#### Prototyping for Mechatronic Systems

- Prototyping automated test stands for quality assurance.
- Designing intelligent sensor-actuator systems.
- Developing integrated sensor modules for machine and plant monitoring.
- Building robotic assistance systems for manual manufacturing.
- Developing adaptive damping systems to reduce vibrations in components.
- Creating smart components with piezoceramics and adaptive systems.

#### Excluded Services

Standard tasks such as:

- Designing photovoltaic systems for residential buildings.
- Designing PID controllers for standardized process chains.
- GUI development for an existing CLI-based calculation tool.
- Developing simple database applications without analytical components.
- Dimensioning standard air conditioning systems for office buildings.

Although these tasks can be handled, there are specialized professionals who can
perform them faster, cheaper, and better. Instead, I focus on challenges that
require non-standardized modeling and unique solutions.
