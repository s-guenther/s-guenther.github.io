The tool was designed to help wind farm
operators determine the feasibility of integrating energy storage systems into
their wind farms. Wind farms often face curtailment, where excess energy
generated by wind turbines cannot be utilized or stored, leading to revenue
losses. This tool addresses the need to optimize energy storage integration,
allowing operators to store curtailed energy and sell it later when prices are
more favorable. 

The project involved developing a comprehensive mathematical model that analyzed
power profiles from wind farms, considering technical constraints such as
storage capacity, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. The model explored various
storage technologies, including their charging and discharging characteristics,
response times, and costs. The tool provides a set of optimal storage
configurations based on the unique needs of each wind farm. 

In addition to assessing the technical feasibility, the tool includes an
economic evaluation, helping operators determine whether investing in energy
storage would be profitable. By analyzing both CAPEX and OPEX, as well as
potential revenue from energy sales, it ensures that all financial aspects are
considered. The result is not just a simple yes or no but an in-depth analysis
of the ideal storage technology, size, and operational strategy. 

One of the most valuable features of this tool is its scalability. Wind farm
operators can apply it across multiple sites, automatically adjusting to
different wind farm configurations and power profiles. This scalability enhances
the tool’s applicability across a wide range of scenarios, making it a valuable
asset for operators managing multiple wind farms. 

Moreover, the tool can be commercialized as a service. Operators can offer the
dimensioning service to other wind farm owners, creating an additional revenue
stream while optimizing their own energy storage systems. This dual function of
the tool increases its overall value and market potential. 

Finally, the tool’s advanced integration capabilities ensure smooth data
exchange with existing systems. Developed with Python and incorporating linear
programming and optimization algorithms, the tool is computationally efficient
and capable of handling large datasets.
