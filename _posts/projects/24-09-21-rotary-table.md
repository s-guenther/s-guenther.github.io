This project realized a custom-built numerically controlled (NC) rotary table, designed
specifically for research into curved composite structures using a Laser
Scanning Vibrometer (LSV). The system allows automated, high-precision
measurement of wave propagation in cylindrical components like carbon fiber
reinforced polymer (CFRP) structures, which are common in aerospace and other
safety-critical applications. 

The rotary table automates the rotation of test objects in small, predefined
angles, making it possible to perform detailed measurements across the entire
surface without the need to manually adjust the experimental setup. This
functionality is critical for capturing accurate data in structural health
monitoring (SHM), where detecting internal damage, such as delamination, can
prevent catastrophic failure in operational environments. 

In this project, I designed and implemented the mechanical system, including the
shaft, bearings, and gear components. Electrical integration involved selecting
and programming a stepper motor control system that interfaces seamlessly with
the Polytec Laser Scanning Vibrometer software, automating the measurement cycle
for efficient data collection. The system is fully capable of performing
automated cycles of rotation and measurement, significantly enhancing the
precision of wave propagation studies in curved structures. 

Beyond its mechanical and electrical components, the rotary table was developed
with extensibility in mind. The design allows for additional axes or sensors to
be easily added, making it suitable for a wide range of SHM studies. For
example, the addition of an XY table on top of the rotary table can extend its
capabilities further. The low-cost design makes it a valuable asset for research
laboratories that need high precision without the expense of commercial systems. 

Although designed primarily for laboratory use, the rotary table provides
significant flexibility in terms of future applications. Its modular
construction and slip ring allow for extensive modifications, and it supports
integration with various data acquisition systems, offering the potential for
future upgrades or more complex experimental setups. 

This project successfully met its objectives, delivering an
affordable, functional rotary table for structural health monitoring research.
The systemâ€™s ability to handle automated measurement cycles offers a scalable
solution that bridges the gap between manual measurements and high-end
commercial systems.
