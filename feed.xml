				<title>Wind Farm</title>
				<link>https://sgrse.de//projects/wind-park/</link>
				<pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The tool was designed to help wind farm
operators determine the feasibility of integrating energy storage systems into
their wind farms. Wind farms often face curtailment, where excess energy
generated by wind turbines cannot be utilized or stored, leading to revenue
losses. This tool addresses the need to optimize energy storage integration,
allowing operators to store curtailed energy and sell it later when prices are
more favorable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project involved developing a comprehensive mathematical model that analyzed
power profiles from wind farms, considering technical constraints such as
storage capacity, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. The model explored various
storage technologies, including their charging and discharging characteristics,
response times, and costs. The tool provides a set of optimal storage
configurations based on the unique needs of each wind farm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to assessing the technical feasibility, the tool includes an
economic evaluation, helping operators determine whether investing in energy
storage would be profitable. By analyzing both CAPEX and OPEX, as well as
potential revenue from energy sales, it ensures that all financial aspects are
considered. The result is not just a simple yes or no but an in-depth analysis
of the ideal storage technology, size, and operational strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most valuable features of this tool is its scalability. Wind farm
operators can apply it across multiple sites, automatically adjusting to
different wind farm configurations and power profiles. This scalability enhances
the tool’s applicability across a wide range of scenarios, making it a valuable
asset for operators managing multiple wind farms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the tool can be commercialized as a service. Operators can offer the
dimensioning service to other wind farm owners, creating an additional revenue
stream while optimizing their own energy storage systems. This dual function of
the tool increases its overall value and market potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the tool’s advanced integration capabilities ensure smooth data
exchange with existing systems. Developed with Python and incorporating linear
programming and optimization algorithms, the tool is computationally efficient
and capable of handling large datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Flywheel</title>
				<link>https://sgrse.de//projects/flywheel/</link>
				<pubDate>Mon, 23 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Flywheel energy storage systems
(FESS) stand out as a promising technology due to their high cycle life, rapid
response time, and efficient power-to-energy ratio. This project aimed to design
and construct a laboratory-scale flywheel system to serve both as a research
demonstrator and as an educational tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting prototype is a 200 Wh flywheel energy storage system, featuring a
rotor composed of high-strength aluminum and carbon fiber reinforced plastic
(CFRP). It spins at a nominal speed of 25,000 rpm, powered by a 3.5 kW permanent
magnet synchronous motor (PMSM). The flywheel operates at overcritical speeds
with medium vacuum conditions, minimizing windage losses and ensuring optimal
performance. Key components, such as the spindle bearings and power electronics,
were carefully selected to ensure smooth operation and control, even under
isolated conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the primary goals of this project was to design a system capable of
demonstrating the key features of flywheel technology. The FESS was built to
showcase flywheel capabilities at exhibitions and in academic settings, with
enough power to brew up to five cups of coffee on a single charge. This vivid
demonstration helps make the technology tangible, attracting interest in both
research and industry. Additionally, the system serves as a laboratory tool for
students, allowing them to study flywheel-specific phenomena such as dynamic
behavior, thermal response, and energy losses in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significant aspect of the design was the consideration of thermodynamic
behavior and rotordynamics. A lumped parameter model was developed to estimate
temperature distribution, and the system’s rotordynamics were tuned using finite
element methods (FEM). This ensured that the flywheel operates safely and
efficiently, even at high speeds. The FESS’s modular setup also facilitates
research into various system parameters, such as vacuum levels, windage losses,
and bearing performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The construction of the flywheel system involved a comprehensive 3D model and
technical drawings, ensuring precision and safety in every component. The design
was iterative, allowing for adjustments based on testing and simulations.
Mechanical safety considerations, such as stress distribution and tolerance for
overspeed, were integrated into the design to minimize the risk of failure. The
system’s housing and auxiliary equipment provide robust protection, while
maintaining a relatively compact form factor.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Rotary Table</title>
				<link>https://sgrse.de//projects/rotary-table/</link>
				<pubDate>Sat, 21 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;This project realized a custom-built numerically controlled (NC) rotary table, designed
specifically for research into curved composite structures using a Laser
Scanning Vibrometer (LSV). The system allows automated, high-precision
measurement of wave propagation in cylindrical components like carbon fiber
reinforced polymer (CFRP) structures, which are common in aerospace and other
safety-critical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rotary table automates the rotation of test objects in small, predefined
angles, making it possible to perform detailed measurements across the entire
surface without the need to manually adjust the experimental setup. This
functionality is critical for capturing accurate data in structural health
monitoring (SHM), where detecting internal damage, such as delamination, can
prevent catastrophic failure in operational environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this project, I designed and implemented the mechanical system, including the
shaft, bearings, and gear components. Electrical integration involved selecting
and programming a stepper motor control system that interfaces seamlessly with
the Polytec Laser Scanning Vibrometer software, automating the measurement cycle
for efficient data collection. The system is fully capable of performing
automated cycles of rotation and measurement, significantly enhancing the
precision of wave propagation studies in curved structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond its mechanical and electrical components, the rotary table was developed
with extensibility in mind. The design allows for additional axes or sensors to
be easily added, making it suitable for a wide range of SHM studies. For
example, the addition of an XY table on top of the rotary table can extend its
capabilities further. The low-cost design makes it a valuable asset for research
laboratories that need high precision without the expense of commercial systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although designed primarily for laboratory use, the rotary table provides
significant flexibility in terms of future applications. Its modular
construction and slip ring allow for extensive modifications, and it supports
integration with various data acquisition systems, offering the potential for
future upgrades or more complex experimental setups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project successfully met its objectives, delivering an
affordable, functional rotary table for structural health monitoring research.
The system’s ability to handle automated measurement cycles offers a scalable
solution that bridges the gap between manual measurements and high-end
commercial systems.&lt;/p&gt;
